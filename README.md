this is basically copied from stroobants-dev/ublock-origin-shitty-copies-filter!
need to confirm how licensing works, but i think i'll just keep the same license
for now and cross my fingers and get to this tomorrow.

changes:
- blocks search results only, not the sites themselves
- some custom additions
- easier to edit (source files and all that)

TODO:
- host at natan.la (to be github agnostic)
- potential tests
  * duplicate lines
  * ublock origin syntax check
  * special characters in filters
  * filters with subdomains
- actually write a readme
- should lists be sorted? or let them be unsorted so i can add comments?
